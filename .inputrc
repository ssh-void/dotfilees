# Use ^. (or ^N, it's the same) to expand aliases in the current line. This can
# be used as a workaround for bash not understanding that an alias should have
# the same completions as the command it's pointing to. (There is
# `shopt -s progcomp_alias`, but it only works when no default completion is set
# up, but with the bash-completion package active, there usually is one. See
# <https://github.com/scop/bash-completion/issues/521> for a summary.)
